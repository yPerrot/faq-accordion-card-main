## Comments ðŸ’¬

### HTML
This is the first time I use the `details` and `summary` tag, what a great discovery!  
I use `div` to create section in my code, but I must take a deep look into most used tags such as `aside` or `article` to improve my code and my understanding.

### CSS
This is also my first time I use `media query`. I did my best but I'm not confident with the way I manage images change, they must be a better solution.  
I had a hard time managing image. I do know how to do it properly.

### JS 
Nothing special.
